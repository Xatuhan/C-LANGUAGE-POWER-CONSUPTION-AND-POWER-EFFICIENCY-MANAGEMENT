Power Consumption Calculator and Power Efficiency Management

My software calculates power consumption by entries of your electrical devices numbers and how many hours you used it for a week.	
When user executed program, firstly program ask you to press 1 to continue. Then you enter the Login Interface.
In login sequence, you create your username and password. And you are ready to calculate :D.
Program asks for your electrical devices numbers and how many hours you used your devices. I used average value for devices watts. It calculates your power consumption. 
If you are above 240 KW per month, your constumption multiplies with 3.10, otherwise multiplies with 2.07.
After data recievement finished, program starts a Solar Panel Interrogation. If you have Solar Panel at your home, program does %50 discount to your bill.
Once power calculating finished, if you would like to see which devices you are using so many hours, YOU CAN!!. Program does that by Y/N interrogation.
Additionally program writes your montly bill and overused devices into a text file. 
If you wish you can read that file either.
